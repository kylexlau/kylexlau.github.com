<h2 id=what-is-library-cache-lock>What is library cache lock?</h2>
<p>From Troubleshooting Library Cache: Lock, Pin and Load Lock (Doc ID 444560.1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This event controls the concurrency between clients of the library
cache. It acquires a lock on the object handle so that either:</p>
<p>One client can prevent other clients from accessing the same object.</p>
<p>The client can maintain a dependency for a long time (for example,
so that no other client can change the object).</p>
<p>This lock is also obtained to locate an object in the library cache.</p>
<p>Library cache lock will be obtained on database objects referenced
during parsing or compiling of SQL or PL/SQL statements (table, view,
procedure, function, package, package body, trigger, index, cluster,
synonym). The lock will be released at the end of the parse or
compilation.</p>
<p>Cursors (SQL and PL/SQL areas), pipes and any other transient objects
do not use this lock. Library cache lock is not deadlock sensitive and
the operation is synchronous.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=why-grant-statment-cause-library-cache-lock>Why grant statment cause library cache lock?</h2>
<p>Because the grant statement need to change the <code>LAST_DDL_TIME</code> of a
object, it must hold a exclusive lock for this object. When you
execute the grant statment, you request a exclusive lock on that
object, but when there are long-running querys on that object holds a
share lock, you must wait that query be done to get the exclusive
lock. Other session can not get a share lock on the object because
you have request to get a exclusive lock. That&rsquo;s my guess why grant
statment can cause many library cache lock waits. And we did some
tests to prove it.</p>
<p>From a blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can definitely say that when you grant privileges on an object in a
production database in the middle of a busy day, you could have
problems.</p>
<p>Today, an application installer was installing some packages in a new
schema. He was granting select/insert/update/delete on several tables
in the data schema. We started seeing a large number of “library cache
lock” wait events for users in another schema that were accessing the
tables on which select privileges were being granted to the new
schema.</p>
<p>It turns out that this operation will actually stamp the
<code>LAST_DDL_TIME</code> column of <code>DBA_OBJECTS</code>. It doesn’t invalidate the
object in the STATUS column of <code>DBA_OBJECTS</code>, but there is a latch
that existing sessions request as a result of this “invalidation”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From MOS note Troubleshooting Library Cache: Lock, Pin and Load Lock
(Doc ID 444560.1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be very careful with altering, granting or revoking privileges on
database objects that frequently used stored PL/SQL is dependent
on. In fact, resolving this issue mostly depends on application
project and system maintenance practices. Application developers
should also consider that some project decisions have negative impact
to the application scalability and performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=howt-to-solve-it>Howt to solve it?</h2>
<p>You can check <code>v$session_blocker</code> to find the blocking and blocked
sessions and find the sqls they&rsquo;re executing.</p>
<p>A systemstate dump during problem time can be very helpful for post
analysis.</p>
<p>And the best solution is just don&rsquo;t do DDLs during system busy
periods.</p>
<p>From &lsquo;library cache lock&rsquo; Waits- Causes and Solutions (Doc ID
1952395.1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not perform DDL operations during busy periods.</p>
<p>DDL will often cause library cache objects to be invalidated and this
could cascade to many different dependent objects like
cursors. Invalidations have a large impact on the library cache,
shared pool, row cache, and CPU since they will likely require many
hard parses to occur at the same time.</p>
<p>Simply schedule DDL during maintenance or low activity periods.</p>
