name taken from Indonesian Language for *Sweet*.

## Get Started

If this is your first time using Hugo, and you want to use this theme. Follow the instruction below:

```
mkdir name_of_web
cd name_of_web
git clone https://github.com/yursan9/manis-hugo-theme themes/manis
cp theme/manis/exampleSite/config.toml config.toml
hugo new blog/_index.md
hugo new work/_index.md
```

Edit the `config.toml` according to your preference. Then edit `content/blog/_index.md` and `content/work/_index.md` by following [this section](#making-own-navigation-bar). (Look at the `exampleSite/content` for example.)

### Theme Only

To only install Manis, you can clone this repository. The following command will clone Manis in your site's base directory.

```
cd path/to/site/dir
git clone https://github.com/yursan9/manis-hugo-theme themes/manis
```

Ensure you have `blog` and `work` sections to make this theme works.

```
content/
├── blog
│   └── _index.md
└── work
    └── _index.md
```

## Configuration

For configuration example you can look at the `exampleSite/config.toml` (and copy that too!). I put some commentary to, hopefully, guide you at using this theme.

### Change Latest Section

By default this theme needs `blog` and `work` section to works. You can edit which sections show up as latest posts and latest works by editing `postSection` and `workSection`. `workSection` is optional.

```toml
# Configure which section for Latest Posts
postSection = "blog"
# Configure which section for Latest Works
workSection = "work"
```

### Disqus Configuration
To add Disqus support, edit your site `config.toml`. Add your discus' shortname to `disqusShortname` and add list of sections that you want to support disqus to `params.disqusSections`:

```toml
disqusShortname = "your-disqus-shortname"

[params]
  disqusSections = ["blog"]
```

### Making Own Navigation Bar

Top navigation bar in Manis is made automatically by making new `section/_index.md`. Example if you want to add new `about` section, you can do the following command:

```
hugo new about/_index.md
```

Edit the file `content/about/_index.md` and make sure the front matter is formatted like this:

```toml
+++
title = "Get To Know Me"
menu = "main"
+++
```

`title` will be the string that is shown in navigation bar and the page's title (the title doesn't need to be the same as section's directory name). `menu = "main"` is the one who make Hugo know how identify it's need to add a new item in navigation bar.

### Other Language

Manis already translated to Bahasa Indonesia. But, if you want to translate this theme to your own language, look for the example in `i18n/en.yaml` and `i18n/in.yaml`.

And then you edit the site's `config.toml` like this.

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
[languages.{Your Language Code}]
  lang = "{Your Language Code}"
  languageName = "{Your Language Name. example; Bahasa Indonesia or Japanese}"
  weight = 1
```
